# Smart-Irrigation-System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage in agricultural settings. The system automatically adjusts watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, ensuring plants receive the precise amount of water needed. This not only conserves water but also promotes healthy plant growth.

## Technology Stack
- **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi 3
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensor (MH Series), Ultrasonic sensor
- **ADC**: ADS1115 for reading sensor analog outputs
- **Actuators**: Water pump
- **Programming Languages**: Python - Flask, TypeScript - Angular
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code

## Features
- Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- Automatic water pump control
- Adjustable moisture thresholds via a user interface
